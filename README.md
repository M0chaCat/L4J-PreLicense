# This is Leagcy4Java before they changed the license, fork off of this repo to actually be able to make works based on L4J, the PolyForm license makes no sense and prevents competitors based on L4J, This however is the MIT license, so ur all gud :3

## **I** personally wont be updating this, thats your job! yes you reading this! fork this and work from there!!

## All links below link to the modern version of L4J, the one with the PolyForm License!!!

**Legacy4J** is a mod about nostalgia of old 4J Studios Minecraft Legacy Edition. The main objective of this mod is remake every aspect of [Legacy Console Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Legacy_Console_Edition) in 1:1 for Java Edition versions, adding its exclusive features, and bringing it to modern versions.

This includes the crafting menu, creative flight, the gamma system, the hud, and more!
